        <span>What is Python?</span>
        <br>
        Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, language. <br>

        <span>Who created Python?<br></span>
        A surprising fact about Python is that it is the work of one person. <br>
        The Python language was created by Guido van Rossum, born in 1956 in Haarlem, in acting. Guido did not develop
        all available Python languages ​​himself. <br>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <img src="assets/Guido.png" alt="pythonphoto" class="Guido">
                </td> 
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>

                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </p>

    <p>
        We can say that every language consists of the following elements: <br>

        alphabet - a set of symbols used to build words <br>
        vocabulary - a set of words that a given language offers to its users <br>
        syntax - a set of rules <br>
        semantics - a set of rules determining whether a certain expression makes sense<br> 
    </p>

        <span>What makes Python so special?</span> <br>


        it is easy to learn - the time needed to learn Python is shorter than in the case of many other languages. This means you can start programming faster. <br>


        it is easy to obtain, install and implement - Python is free, open and cross-platform; not all languages ​​can boast of this. <br>
        Of course, Python also has its disadvantages: <br>

        is not fast - Python does not provide exceptional performance – this may mean that Python code may be more difficult to debug than other languages. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
       <span> Where can we see Python in action?</span><br>
        
        It is widely used to implement complex web services such as search engines, cloud storage, social media and so on.
