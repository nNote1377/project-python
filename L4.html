        </div>
    <p>
        The While command creates a loop, which requires a condition, and at the end we give :, which means the start of the loop. <br>
        If you do it in the program we recommend, an indent will also be created, which indicates that it belongs to the above function. <br>
        Example conditions: x==y(If the number x is equal to the number y), x!=y (The number x is not equal to the number y), x > y or x < y (The number x is greater or less than y),<br>
        True (If the loop should execute no matter what), False (If the loop should not execute no matter what)<br>
    </p>
        <div class="code1">
            <code id="fun"><span>If</span></code><br>
        </div>
    <p>
        if is a conditional command that will execute the command if the given condition is met. <br>
        The conditions are the same as for the while command, and there is also a sign at the end: <br>
    </p>
    
        <div class="code1">
            <code id="fun"><span>Elif & Else</span></code><br>
        </div>
    <p>
        elif is to give another option to the if command, after elif we give a condition and at the end we put: <br>
        else the else command is executed when none of the if and elif conditions are met, no condition is added here and at the end it also reads: <br>
    </p>
    
        <div class="code1">
            <code id="fun"><span>Import</span></code><br>
        </div>
    <p>
        Thanks to import, we can add libraries that expand the possibilities of our project. <br>
        This is used in the first lines of the program, by using the command import library_name or from library_name import * <br>
        Useful libraries are: math, tkinter, random, sys, turtle, time, numpy <br>
